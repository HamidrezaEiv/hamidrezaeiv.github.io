In our research, we tackled the challenging problem of predicting how batteries degrade over time, a critical issue for advancing green technology and sustainable energy. Our solution, DiffBatt, utilizes advanced techniques from GenAI to accurately model and predict battery health.

**Key Points**:
    - **Probabilistic & Generative:** DiffBatt captures the uncertainties in battery aging and simulates these changes over time effectively.
    - **Top Performance:** It outperforms other models by predicting battery life with great accuracy across several datasets.
    - **Scalable & Expressive:** Based on diffusion models, DiffBatt uses classifier-free guidance to generate robust, high-quality degradation curves.

We believe DiffBatt is a crucial step toward establishing a foundational model for battery degradation. By training on diverse datasets, it offers strong generalizability and robustness, paving the way for more sustainable tech solutions.
