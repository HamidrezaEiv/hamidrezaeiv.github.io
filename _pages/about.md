**About Me**

Hi there! I'm Hamidreza Eivazi, a Research Assistant and PhD student at the Institute for Software and Systems Engineering at [Clausthal University of Technology](https://www.tu-clausthal.de/) in Germany. I'm also a member of [Research Training Group CircularLIB](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/circularlib), where we’re tackling the exciting challenge of making lithium-ion batteries more sustainable. Previously, I was fortunate to spend some time at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) in Stockholm, diving into the world of computational fluid dynamics and machine learning.

**Research Interests**

I’m passionate about exploring the intersection of scientific machine learning and computational physics. My work focuses on developing physics-informed machine learning models, reduced-order modeling, finite-element simulations, and high-performance computing techniques to tackle complex, multiscale physical problems.
