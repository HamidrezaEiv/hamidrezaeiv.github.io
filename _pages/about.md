**About Me**

Hi there! I'm Hamidreza Eivazi, a Research Assistant and PhD student at the Institute for Software and Systems Engineering at Clausthal University of Technology in Germany. I'm also a member of Research Training Group CircularLIB, where we’re tackling the exciting challenge of making lithium-ion batteries more sustainable. Previously, I was fortunate to spend some time at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, diving into the world of computational fluid dynamics and machine learning. I also hold a Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Tehran. Along the way, I’ve contributed to a number of publications and presented at international conferences.

**Research Interests**

I’m passionate about exploring the intersection of scientific machine learning and computational physics. My work focuses on developing physics-informed machine learning models, reduced-order modeling, finite-element simulations, and high-performance computing techniques to tackle complex, multiscale physical problems. I love finding innovative solutions and sharing these discoveries with the broader scientific community.
